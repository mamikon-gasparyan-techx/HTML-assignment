      <h1>Waste Management in Circular Economy</h1>
      <h2>Al Capone</h2>
      <p>
        Most human activities generates waste (Brunner and Rechberger, 2014).    Despite that, the production of wastes remain a major source of concern as it has always been since pre historic period (Chandler et al, 1997).   In recent times, the rate and quantity of waste generation have been on the increase.    As the volume of wastes increases, so also does the variety of the waste increases (Vergara and Tchobanoglous, 2012). Unlike the pre historic period where wastes were merely a source of nuisance that needed to be disposed of. Proper management was not a major issue as the population was small and a vast amount of land was available to the population at that time.    In those days, the environment easily absorbed the volume of waste produced without any form of degradation (Tchobanoglous et al, 1993).

        A substantial increase in volume of wastes generation began in the sixteenth century when people began to move from rural areas to cities as a result of industrial revolution (Wilson, 2007). This migration of people to cities led to population explosion that in turn led to a surge in the volume and variety in composition of wastes generated in cities. It was then that materials such as metals and glass began to appear in large quantities in municipal waste stream (Williams, 2005). The large population of people in cities and communities gave rise to indiscriminate littering and open dumps. These dumps in turn formed breeding grounds for rats and other vermin, posing significant risks to public health. The unhealthy waste management practices resulted in several outbreaks of epidemics with high death tolls (Tchobanoglous et al, 1993). Consequently, in the nineteenth century public officials began to dispose waste in a controlled manner in other to safe guard public health (Tchobanoglous et al, 1993).

        Most developed countries passed through a period when they were developing environmentally. Today, however, most of these countries have effectively addressed much of the health and environmental pollution issues associated with wastes generation. In contrast, the increasing rate of urbanisation and developments in emerging countries is now leading to a repeat of the same historical problems that developed countries have had to address in the past (Wilson, 2007).
